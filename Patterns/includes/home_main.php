				 he slowly begins to piece together details of his basic existence.  Suddenly he finds himself going through
				 motions that ultimately propel him towards an odd encounter with an unknown Man.  That encounter will alter
				 the course of history.  Ultimately, the Man is a visual metaphor for LIFE</p>
